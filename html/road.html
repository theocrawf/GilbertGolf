                <p>... at the age of 13 and was immediately hooked to the game. Ever since I picked up a golf
                   club, I've had this unwavering desire to play the best golf to my ability. I suddenly found myself shooting in the 70's
                    within the first year. I then made the varsity high school golf team as a freshman where I soon discovered the pressure 
                    of tournament golf which was just one of many learning experiences. I didn't have a sophomore season because I was in 
                    the transition of moving to Rota, Spain with my parents, but that didn't stop me from playing. I continued to improve 
                    and joined the team at my new high school in Spain and won the DoDDS European Golf Title my junior year in 2003. I had 
                    a chance to repeat my senior year leading after day 1 but just didn't have enough to finish the job on day two. Another lesson learned.

                      After high school, I was not recruited to play at the collegiate level, so I concentrated on my education at Texas
                       A&M University-Kingsville where I earned my degree in Electrical Engineering in 2010. While earning my degree, 
                       I worked at the local golf course where I would also play and practice as much as I could and soon realized that 
                       I had the ability to shoot in the high to mid-60's. At this point in time I had not taken a single lesson, but
                        learned a good deal from the great players with whom I would golf. After graduating college, I tried to find a 
                        career in EE but just didn't feel the desire. There was always something about golf and the dream of playing on 
                        tour that kept me wondering, so I decided to enroll into the Golf Academy of America-San Diego in 2012. It was there
                         where I began taking lessons to improve my technique and learn about the golf industry. It was also there where I
                          discovered GOLFTEC and joined the team after graduating from the Golf Academy in 2013.

            <p>While teaching my students at GOLFTEC and helping them improve, I was also honing my skills to compete on a professional 
              level. I would compete and I still do in many Southern Texas PGA events and any other professional events I can find in Austin, 
              Houston, or Dallas areas. It took me years of dedication, hours upon hours of practice, and the desire to fulfill my dream, 
              but I finally broke through. I won the 2020 Southern Texas PGA Championship hosted at Boot Ranch Golf Club with the scores of 
              66 and 67 for a total of 9 under in 2 days winning by 5 shots. This qualified me for the 2021 National PGA Professional 
              Championship in Florida where they take the top 20 from that event to play in the 2021 PGA Major Championship. I also qualified
               for the 2021 Texas State Open and earned exemption into the 2021 Houston Open, which is a PGA Tour event!!
